# Generating pseudo fractographs

A fractograph is an image of the fracture surface. Here we try to
generate an image of some aspects of the patterns seen on a fatigue
crack due under a simple repeated loading sequence. This will allow
patterns to be seen on the fracture surface so that we can measure the
rate of growth or use to understand the crack growth mechanisms. Do
not get your hopes up about the quality of the image.

In order to generate a pseudo-fractograph we need two models.

1. A model for crack growth, and
2. a model that generates an equivalent grey-scale for the loading.

The image will also depend on the type of fractographic image we are
trying to replicate and this depends on the type of microscope used
for taking the image such as a scanning electron microscope (SEM)
image or an optical microscope image. The two types of image generate
contrast in different ways.

Firstly, the optical image basically appears as a grey shaded image
where dark regions are generated by reflecting light away from the
lens and bright regions reflect more light toward the lens. Thus with
an optical microscopic image, the light and dark regions correspond to
the changes in path of the fracture surface. There may also be
a textural component where the surface generated is more or less
reflective depending on the mode of crack growth. Secondly, with an
SEM, bright areas occur when more secondary electrons are released from
the surface, which typically occurs where there are sharp features.

The fracto image file is generated by using the
`--image_outfile` to the *easigro* command line. For example,
adding `--image_outfile seq1.svg` to the command line will
produce a pseudo fracto image in the file `seq1.svg`. Note, it
is required to provide a file name with the suffix `svg` so
that the image is in Scalable Vector Graphics (svg) format. These
`svg` commands are then rendered by the viewer on the users
computer.

The use of `svg` format uses vectors instead of
pixels which allows you to zoom in to any part of the sequence down to the
resolution of one striation.

Even so, it is still probably wise to not generate too many blocks in
the image as this will inevitably result in a wide range of blocks
sizes which will need significant amount of zooming in to recognise
the individual segments. 

Here is an example that produces a fracto image.
