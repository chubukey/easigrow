* **Sequence filtering** Performs sequence reordering,
   turning-point, dead-band, rise-fall filtering and rain-flow
   counting.  The filtered sequences may be written to a file.

* **Inbuilt data** Comes with a selection of beta factors,
   material data and crack growth models.

* **Calculated parameters** Calculates additional parameters for
   characterising the state of the crack tip so that better
   crack growth equations can be developed based on the most
   applicable parameters for a material.

* **Optimisation** Optimises the crack growth model parameters to
   minimise the difference between predicted and measured crack
   growth. The measured data need not be for the entire history
   i.e., one or more fractographic measurements of the width of
   a block.

* **Image generation** Generates a pseudo fractographic image of the fracture
   surface to see how easy it is to identify the individual
   blocks.

static UNITS: &'static str = "The internal da/dN data are all in units
for stress intensity of (MPa m^0.5) and growth in (m). Most beta
equations use an applied far field stress which is in units of
(MPa). Thus the scaling factor in units of (MPa) will generally
convert the sequence into the correct units. However, the
compact-tension beta factor compact_tada73 uses applied load not
stress and is in units of load of (MN) and coupon dimensions are in
(m). The width and depth will need to be set for the compact-tension
beta function otherwise **easiGrow** will assume an infinite plate and
the crack will not grow.";
